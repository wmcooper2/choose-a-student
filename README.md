### Notes
* The build folder was renamed to "choose-a-student"
* This is a simple, cross-browser tool that allows you to choose students without seat numbers or names.

Often, students are too shy/lazy/unininterested/etc to raise their hand.
Additionally, in my school the classes are shuffled around for English class which makes choosing students based on seat number slightly annoying. 

To use:
* the squares represent the most common class arrangement (6x6)
* click the "Random" button
* you can click the squares directly which removes them from the random selction

Ideas for future functionality:
* add a drag drop feature to customize the seating arrangements
* add other common classroom arrangements (lunch groups, etc)
* add a glow around the seat that was chosen most recently and remove it when a new seat is chosen.
