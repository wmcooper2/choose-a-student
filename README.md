* An app to choose classroom "volunteers" without seat numbers or names.

## Purpose/Goal
This app removes the stress of a student feeling "singled out" by a teacher, and offers a fair way to determine volunteer order when a task is given.  

## Operation
* the squares represent the most common class arrangement (6x6)
* click the "Random" button
* you can click the squares directly which removes them from the random selection
* click the seat again to put it back in the random selection
* the most recently, randomly selected seat is a different color (so you dont have to remember which one is next)

## Tech/Libraries Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* React

## Problems/Solutions
Often, students are too shy/lazy/unininterested/etc to raise their hand. In my schools the classes are often shuffled around for English class which makes choosing students based on seat number slightly annoying. This app can help speed things up because the students won't laze about wasting time deciding who goes first.

## More Information
Ideas for future functionality:
* add a drag drop feature to customize the seating arrangements
* add other common classroom arrangements (lunch groups, etc)
